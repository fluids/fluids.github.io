# Research

My research focuses on multiscale environmental fluid dynamics in natural and engineered systems, including:

- Riverbed and stream hydrodynamics
- Glacier-ocean interactions
- Flow battery simulation
- 3D model generation from UAV imagery
- AI-assisted measurement of sediment and flow fields
