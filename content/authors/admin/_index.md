      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Yunxiang Chen is a mathematician in the Computational Mathematics group within Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s (PNNL’s) Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate. Chen’s work at PNNL includes using computational, mathematical, and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to understand the hydro-biogeochemical processes in river ecosystems and the electrochemical processes in flow battery cells. 

Before moving to PNNL, Chen worked on numerical modeling of subglacial hydrology beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet, hydraulics in mountain streams, and 3D mesh generation development for complex in-stream structures in civil engineering at Pennsylvania State University and studied computational fluid dynamics, naval engineering, and ocean engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Chen has a strong interest in using computational and computer vision AI methods to solve challenging problems related to water and fluid in Earth science and engineering. His career goal is to develop computational and observational capabilities to better predict dynamic changes in hydrology, clean energy, and engineering and to gain new knowledge of how Earth's water works and how humans can better utilize natural laws to create a better life. Thus far, Chen has been working on different research areas in hydrology, cryosphere, hydraulics, battery storage, mesh generation, drone-based remote sensing, and computer vision AI.
